# hello_world
my first repository on github.
This repository will probably start off with a few small python projects of mine, and will grow into something bigger based off of one of the smaller projects. This repository may or may not be deleted as i learn more and experiment with python/github.

for now, let's start with the idea that i plan to upload some code that will scrape pro-football-reference.com (http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201702050atl.htm for example), parse the relevant xml (play by play stats), and store that data into a locally running db (mysql (likely) or sqlite). 

so this readme file is not actually what most readme files are supposed to be - this is the beginning of a "project" and if you are reading this without first hearing from me, this is what you will get.
